Group Repo for team Apple jOOSE

To run our project, first go to chrome://extensions/ and enable developer settings.
Once that's done click 'Load Unpacked' button on the same page and then navigate to the src/main
folder in the 'AppleJuice' project directory and select it as the extension source. Finally,
enable it for us on your chrome browser. As for the server side of the project, simple run the
main method of the Main.java file under AppleJuice/src/main/java folder. Running this file should
create the database and establish the server connection to localhost:7000.

Iteration 1 Notes:
* We definitely did not achieve all of our functional requirements as we are still lacking some
key API implementation and client side functionality. However, most of the server/database side of 
the project is complete and should be already have most of the functions we will need for the rest of 
this project already implemented.
