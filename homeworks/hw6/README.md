# MyBooksApp

In this homework, we added post methods to the /authors and 
/books roots so that fields could be filled to add relevant
entries, automatically updating them on the page as they 
are entered. We assumed that fields were complete and 
added validations based on the HW5 instructions (i.e. author
name is of form "first second third..." and isbn follows
the given convention).

Work Done:  
* Kevin: validate.js, books.vm, addbook.vm, readme
* Connor: post/get methods in server.java
* Simon: addauthor.vm, authors.vm, delauthor.js
* Montese: mybooksapp.css, minor html formatting
* Joao: cleanup code, formatting, bug fixing
* Morgan: nothing
