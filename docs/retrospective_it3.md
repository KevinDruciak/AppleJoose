Retrospective for iteration 3

In this past iteration, we managed to connect the front end to our back end. The statistics being fed into the front end are being read directly from the database. We updated our class architecture to reflect our needs. We almost finished implementing a full login feature, but couldn't merge into the main branch due to the aforementioned change in class architecture. Now that we've accomplished this, we can focus on implementing the actual product we had in mind. In this next iteration, we hope to improve upon our application's ability to scrape the correct information from the article the user reads. This means getting the correct article title, source, and body text off of the URL they give us. Furthermore, we wish to implement filtering, so it only stores news sources. We compelted a lot of work in iteration 3, but not all of it could be merged into the main branch, due to changes in our class architecture. So, we will aim to finish those features, and merge them onto the main branch. We've also fixed a lot of the issues with the API calls, so they now POST and GET without flaw. We also wish to start developing more statistics we can offer the user, such as time spent on the article. In addition, we are going to need to update our front end to be able to display these statistics. Hopefully, by the end of iteration 4, we'll have much more of a viable product than before.
