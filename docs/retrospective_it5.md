Restrospective for iteration 5

For this iteration, we continue to implement and polish front-end functionality to our app. This includes statistics pages, graphical elements and basic website navigation elements. Although not finished or in its final state, the current appearance of the app is indicative of the direction we want it to take as well as a representation of all the information we initially wanted to display and make available to our users. Along with these major visual and usage changes, we continue to fix bugs in the backend of our system, implement algorithmic methods for data analysis and comparison as well as implementing automatic articles and user history population through our in-house chrome extension (which is an optional feature for our users who browse through Google Chrome). As a team, we definietly came together for this iteration and were able to divide up the work well between members as well as come together while working on the project in order to touch base and discuss the progress of our development.
