Retrospective iteration 4

For this iteration we have been able to implemement a simpling account creation and login functionality as well as deploy the app to heroku so it is no longer only hosted locally and can be accessed from anywhere. As far as next steps for the project all that is left to do is polish the user interface, sort out some small bugs and overall implement fluid user interactivity with the app as it seems to lack some much needed stability in it current state.
