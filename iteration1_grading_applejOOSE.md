# Iteration 1

_(Grading based on commit `3acbf5e8988a340e752c9354b8a88f96ee059fa4`)_

## Requirement Specification (18/20)

- Very clear problem statement and proposed solution.

- Nice job laying out the requirements and user stories.

- Since this is dependent on Chrome Extension APIs as well as a "political bias API", can you all list them in your SRS so that we can validate that these APIs actually exist and work?

## Class Diagram (10/10)

- Lots of detailed fields. Looks good!

## Git Activities (8/15)

- Little bit of an imbalance in # of commits being pushed by each person.

- Branches named "test", "test2" etc are not very useful. Try to create branches based on features. Seems like most of the work is being done directly on master?

## Github Project (10/10)

## Implementation (15/20)

- Not totally sure which functional requirement was completed in this iteration. Iteration 1 is definitely more weighted towards design/planning but the actual coding work in this iteration was a little sparse.

- From our conversations, it seemed like you would first start with creating a web-client and then focus on the Chrome extension. It didn't seem like that was attempted in this iteration.

## README (5/5)

- Can you provide a more step-by-step description of how to run the app in your README for the next iteration?

## Comments

#### Things Done Well

- Well organized SRS

- Good class diagram

#### Things That Can Be Improved

- Work needs to be better distributed between the team

- Github project board needs to be better organized

- Focus on building out a functional client-server architecture first
